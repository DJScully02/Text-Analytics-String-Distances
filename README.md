### Data Source
The dataset we are using is from the babynames library and iscalled 'babynames' it was collected by the Social Security Administration (SSA), It was collected from the years 1880 to 2017, it has columns for the name, how many children were named that name, their gender, the year, and the proportion. This dataset also only takes into account names that have over 5 uses.

### Project Categories

**Data Science, Text Analytics, String Matching/Distance Calculation, Data Visualization, R Programming**

### Project Goals

1. **Finding Similar Names Using String Distances**
   - Find the ten names in the babynames::babynames data set that are the most similar to the first name "Christian" using various string distance metrics.
Time Series Plotting

2. **Time Series Plotting**
   - Plot the identified names as time series by year.

3. **Comparison of String Distance Metrics**
   - Articulate the similarities and differences observed for each string distance metric used.
